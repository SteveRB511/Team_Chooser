##General Rules:

*1-point each for picking a week's winner and a weeks's loser
    
*The same team cannot be chosen as a winner or as a loser more than once per season unless there are no other options
    
*If one is confident of picking a correct winner and a correct loser for a week, one can go for 3 points. Howevever, if one or both picks are wrong the person will get a -1 point score for that week.
